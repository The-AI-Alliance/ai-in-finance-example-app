Welcome to the **The AI Alliance**: **Example Application for AI in Finance**. 

> **NOTE:** This is a new initiative. Do you have finance industry expertise? Do you have AI expertise? Do you want to grow your expertise in either area. Please join us! See our [contributing]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing) page for details.

Why create another example application? This example application probes the most important functional and non-functional requirements of a representative finance application that leverages AI. We intend to go _deep_, rather than provide a superficial example, to explore where realistic concerns have to be properly addressed for successful reliable production deployments. 

This project leverages the AI Alliance expertise in agent-based development, use of MCP, and use of AI testing and benchmarking technologies for effective testing of AI applications.
